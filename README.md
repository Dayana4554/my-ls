my-ls

Overview

    "my-ls" is a custom implementation of the classic Unix ls command, created as part of a programming exercise.      This project aims to replicate the functionality of ls with support for several of its commonly used flags.       The program is written in Go and is designed to mimic the behavior of ls in listing files and directories         with additional options for sorting, formatting, and more.


Objectives

    To create a custom version of the ls command.
    To support key flags of ls including -l (long listing format), -R (recursive), -a (all entries), -r (reverse      order), and -t (sort by modification time).
    Ensure the -l display is identical to the system's ls command.
    Implement additional flags and their combinations as in the original ls.

Instructions

    The project is written in Go.
    Adherence to good coding practices is expected.
    Unit testing is recommended.
    Usage of the os/exec package is prohibited within the my-ls codebase.
